# This is my Graduate-level final project for my Advanced Data Science course. My team (Nai Hola and Enrique Diaz de Leon Hicks) and I did the following:  

0. Engineered a Transformer-based quantile regression model to forecast IBMâ€™s 5-day return distribution.
1. Backtested a trading strategy that delivered a 63.6% P&L (vs. 36.9% baseline) with superior risk-adjusted performance.
